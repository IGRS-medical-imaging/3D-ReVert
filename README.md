<h1 align="center">3D-ReVert: 3D Reconstruction of Vertebrae from a Single Radiograph for Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery
</h1>

<p  align="center">  
 
Intraoperative imaging during Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery (MISS) typically relies on C-arm fluoroscopy, which generates 2D X-ray images of the vertebrae but lacks depth information. While preoperative CT scans offer detailed 3D anatomical insights, their use during surgery is often impractical due to limitations in space and equipment mobility, making the availability of real-time 3D anatomical context during the procedure incomplete and challenging. We propose 3DReVert, a novel deep learning framework to obtain the surface reconstruction of the lumbar vertebrae from the 2D DRRs. The dataset required for training 3D-ReVert can be downloaded from: [3DReVert-Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YBzQlRE8mZOfmKDpoc9omabz6GCIIJbH?usp=sharing)

You can download the dataset from the following link:

ðŸ”— [3DReVert-Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YBzQlRE8mZOfmKDpoc9omabz6GCIIJbH?usp=sharing) 

We present an open-source dataset for SVR of lumbar vertebrae comprising of 475 unique meshâ€“DRR pairs. For each mesh, DRRs are rendered from 24 diverse view-points, resulting in an
augmented dataset of 11,400 meshâ€“DRR pair  
   - The 3DReVert-dataset is split into train, validation and test data in the70:20:10 split
