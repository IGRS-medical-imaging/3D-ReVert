`Abstract`:Single-view surface reconstruction (SVR) of the vertebra is a technique used to reconstruct the 3D surface from a single 2D radiograph. This has great potential to improve Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery (MISS) and Mixed Reality (MR) assisted spine surgeries by providing real time 3D anatomical context in surgical field of view from a single radiograph, thereby reducing radiation exposure.


`Problem Statement`: Reconstruction of 3D surface model of the lumbar vertebrae from a single 2D Radiograph for real-time 3D anatomical context for more informative tracking and guidance.

`Method`: We propose 3DReVert, a novel deep learning framework to obtain the surface reconstruction of the lumbar vertebrae from the 2D DRRs. Our generated dataset [3DReVert-Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YBzQlRE8mZOfmKDpoc9omabz6GCIIJbH?usp=sharing) consisting of DRR-Mesh pairs is used to train our model.

`Results`: . The surface reconstructed using the 3DReVert framework achieves a Dice Score of 80% and an HD95 of 2.06 mm, demonstrating a clinical accuracy well within the 2 mm threshold.
